[Store](https://github.com/bredele/store) is a little project I worked on that is basically a wrapper for data models and collections. It provides many features such as formatters, access control, update events, computed properties, reset, local storage and way more.

Data models are the spin of every modern pseudo-MVC frameworks. That's thanks to the model that you can be notified of a change, format or compute your data, do crazy magic live binding, save your data or send it to a remote server.

  > Do I need a model if the only thing I want is to store my data?

Like if a model wasn't enough complicated, there is collections. A collection is an ordered set of models...well, a list-array of models. It doesn't provide much more than an array does and I consider that is a huge overhead that makes your application just more complicated that it should be. Here's an example with [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/#Collection) collections:

{% highlight js %}
var Todo = Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults: {
    title: '',
    completed: false
  }
});

var TodosCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Todo
});

var myTodo = new Todo({title:'Read the whole book', id: 2});

// pass array of models on collection instantiation
var todos = new TodosCollection([myTodo]);
{% endhighlight %}

and the same with **store**:

{% highlight js %}
var todos = new Store([{
  title: 'Read the whole book',
  completed: false
}]);
{% endhighlight %}

I guess the example speak enough...all things concerned, a collection seems to do the same thing than a model : it **stores and notifies you when the data change**. So why couldn't we have a single object that manage everything for you?

## <a class="post-section" href="#letsdosimple">Let's do simple</a>

Store is **focused around the data** and provide the same behaviour and API on top of an Object (model) or an Array (collection).

{% highlight js %}
var store = new Store({
  github: 'bredele'
});
store.get('github'); //bredele

store.reset([{
  name: 'Olivier Wietrich'
}
]);
store.get(0).name; //Olivier Wietrich
{% endhighlight %}

I invite you to read the API doc at this [link](https://github.com/bredele/store).
