[Store](https://github.com/bredele/store) is a little project I worked on that is basically a wrapper for data models and collections. It provides many features such as formatters, access control, update events, computed properties, reset, local storage and way more. I invite you to read the API doc at this [link](https://github.com/bredele/store).

Data models are the spin of every modern pseudo-MVC frameworks. That's thanks to the model that you can be notified of a change, format or compute your data, do crazy magic live binding, save your data or send it to a remote server.

Like if a model wasn't enough complicated, there is collections. A collection is an ordered set of models...well, a list-array of models. It doesn't provide much more than an array does and I consider that is a huge overhead that makes your application just more complicated that it should be. Here's an example with **Backbone** collections:

```js
var Todo = Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults: {
    title: '',
    completed: false
  }
});

var TodosCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Todo
});

var myTodo = new Todo({title:'Read the whole book', id: 2});

// pass array of models on collection instantiation
var todos = new TodosCollection([myTodo]);
```

and the same with **store**:

```js
var todos = new Store([{
	title: 'Read the whole book',
	completed: false
}]);
```

I guess the example speak enough...all things concerned, a collection seems to do the same thing than a model : it **stores and notifies you when the data change**. So why couldn't we have a single object that manage everything for you?
