This is not the first time I try to put a blog together. It took me a couple of years, a big dose of motivation and many development iterations. I tried tumblr which gave me a hard time and eventually I decided to use **github**. It works out pretty well and it's really conveniant for a geek like me that spend all his free time doing [open source](http://github.com/bredele) development.

It's my first year in Canada. I came from France a few months ago with the idea to get new opportunities and challenges.
