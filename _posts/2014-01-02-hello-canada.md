This is not the first time I try to put a blog together. It took me a couple of years, a big dose of motivation and many development iterations. I tried tumblr which gave me a hard time and eventually I decided to use **github**. It works out pretty well and it's really conveniant for a geek like me that spend all his free time doing [open source](http://github.com/bredele) development.

It's my first year in Calgary Canada. I came from France a few months ago with the idea to escape my anonymous life. I wanted to stop going round in circles and get new opportunities and challenges.

I wanted a new start and this is the reason why I wanted some place to write my thoughts and share the projects I'm working on.<!--  I remember my first employer here who said that a foreigner should never speak out in public, well that's kind of my goal and writing this blog is a good start. --> So far I really enjoy Canada, I met a lot of awesome people and I'm really glad to be here. I will write soon other articles about my adventures in Canada
