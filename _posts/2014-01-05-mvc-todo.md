I started doing web development four years ago. That was the beginning of long fights with my girlfriend who blames me to spend too much time with my computer. Well it's kind of true but on the other hand, I learned a lot and I came to a conclusion:

I believe it's better to conceive an application by splitting it into smaller and self contained components with lower responsabilities. It gives more control over your application which becomes easier to test, reuse and maintain (see [Artery](http://github.com/bredele/artery)).

**Building an application should be like playing to Legos**. You choose only the bricks you need, assemble them to build something amazing. The possibilities are limitless! A brick is something simple, that has one shape and one color. Also, removing a brick and adding one won't break the others.

The future of web tends to be more like legos. A good example would be the imminent coming of [web components](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/customelements/). That's one of the reason why I don't use MVC frameworks anymore!

<p class="todo-container">
  Instead, I use some <strong>small <a href="http://github.com/bredele">components</a></strong> I developed that does one thing and only one. By assembling them, I have <strong>all the features and sometimes more that provide some MVC frameworks</strong>. Here's the famous todomvc app built with these components:
</p>

All the components can be reused on both client and server side (with [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)). An other advantage is the control you have over your development. For example, you won't finish using jQuery just to do some query selections. Thereby, your **implementations would be smaller and probably faster**. Not convinced? Take a look at my [todo implementation](https://raw.github.com/bredele/todo/master/index.js) and 
compare it to Backbone ([implementation](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/gh-pages/architecture-examples/backbone/js) and [benchmark](http://swannodette.github.io/todomvc/architecture-examples/backbone/index.html)).

I presented in this post my own implementation of [todomvc](http://todomvc.com/). The todo mvc website is kind of great to compare framework but I don't think you should use it to choose a framework though. First because building a large scale application is totally different of building a simple todo list. You need to think about the environment before choosing a framework:
  - what client side dependencies manager? (requirejs, commonjs, etc)
  - what package manager? (component, bower, etc)
  - what client side builder? (component, requirejs, yeoman, etc)
  - unit/bdd testing? (mocha, jasmine, etc)
  - assets management? (styl, less, sass, etc)
  - isomorphic? (nodejs)

By experience, asking myself these questions deviate me to choose Backbone, Angular or Ember. In my opinion, some arguments such as the community, the number of examples are not legitimate. Unfortunately, that's the war of the loudest.

I will soon write an article about how important it is to consider an holistic approach when choosing a framework in the industry.
