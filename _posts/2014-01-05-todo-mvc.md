I started doing web development four years ago. That was the beginning of long fights with my girlfriend who blames me to spend too much time with my computer. Well it's kind of true but on the other hand, I learned a lot and I came to a conclusion: 

## <a class="post-section" href="#noframework">I don't need a framework</a>

I'm talking about the thousand of MV* frameworks out there such as Backbone, Angular, Dojo or Ember. I experienced some and wasn't convinced, I even did my own (called [olives](http://github.com/flams/olives)) but it wasn't enough.

The problem partly related to the fact I'm really opiniated as well as these frameworks. I like simple and old plain JavaScript. I'm looking to write the exact same code on both client and server side (with [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)). I only swear by inversion of control, separation of responsabilities and maintainability. I don't like using object literals to define my modules... The list is long, and I could go on but it's only a matter of taste and you may be already found the framework that fits your needs.
