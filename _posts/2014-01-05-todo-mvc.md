I started doing web development four years ago. That was the beginning of long fights with my girlfriend who blames me to spend too much time with my computer. Well it's kind of true but on the other hand, I learned a lot and I came to a conclusion:

I believe it's better to conceive an application by splitting it into smaller and self contained components with lower responsabilities. It gives more control over your application which becomes easier to test, reuse and maintain (see [Artery](http://github.com/bredele/artery)).

**Building an application should be like playing to Legos**. You choose only the bricks you need, assemble them to build something amazing. The possibilities are limitless! A brick is something simple, that has one shape and one color. Also, removing a brick and adding one won't break the others.

The future of web tends to be more like legos. A good example would be the imminent coming of [web components](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/customelements/). That's one of the reason why I don't use MVC frameworks anymore!

Instead, I use some **small [components](http://github.com/bredele)** I developed that does one thing and only one. By assembling them, I have **all the features and sometimes more that provide some MVC frameworks**. Here's the famous todomvc app built with these components:

<div class="todo"></div>


All the components can be reused on both client and server side (with [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)). An other advantage is the control you have over your development. For example, you won't finish using jQuery just to do some query selections. Thereby, your **implementations would be smaller and probably faster**. Not convinced? Take a look at my [todo implementation](https://raw.github.com/bredele/todo/master/index.js) and 
compare it to Backbone ([implementation](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/gh-pages/architecture-examples/backbone/js) and [benchmark](http://swannodette.github.io/todomvc/architecture-examples/backbone/index.html)).

## <a class="post-section" href="#noframework">I don't need a framework</a>

I'm talking about the thousand of MV* frameworks out there such as Backbone, Angular, Dojo or Ember. I experienced some and wasn't convinced, I even did my own (called [olives](http://github.com/flams/olives)) but it wasn't enough.

The problem partly related to the fact I'm really opiniated as well as these frameworks. I like simple and old plain JavaScript. I'm looking to write the exact same code on both client and server side (with [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/)). I only swear by inversion of control, separation of responsabilities and maintainability. I don't like using object literals to define my modules... The list is long, and I could go on but it's only a matter of taste and you may be already found the framework that fits your needs.

The problem is not much the framework but the developer. There is a lot of example ()

You can't create and architecture a large scale application like a simple todo list otherwise you'll finish by sharing your models, having composite layouts, layout managers
Is the community a good argument to choose a framework? 

I don't think so 



An other problem was that these frameworks are usually pretty good to do simple things but it become quickly complicated when you want to create a large scale application. 

Some paradigms such as sharing your models, composite layouts or layouts manager are a nightmare to maintain. 

You finish by sharing models between views, doing
