[Event](https://github.com/bredele/event) is a little component I'm using to listen, remove, filter or delegate events in some of my projects (see [maple](https://github.com/leafs/maple) or [event-plugin](https://github.com/bredele/event-plugin)). Nothing really new you may say, well it's not entirely true...


## <a class="post-section" href="#attach">Attach</a>

[Event](https://github.com/bredele/event) is a cross-browser event binder. Here's below how to add an event listener:

{% highlight js %}
var event = require('event');

event.attach(document.body, 'click', function(ev, target) {
  //do something
});
{% endhighlight %}

and also remove one:

{% highlight js %}
event.detach(document.body,'click', fn);
{% endhighlight %}

IE8 events don't have a `target` properties (they use `srcElement` instead). This is why [Event](https://github.com/bredele/event) pass the target node as the second argument of handler's callback.

## <a class="post-section" href="#delegation">Event delegation</a>

Spreading event handlers accross your application might take a long time especially on mobile devices. This is one of the reason why it is considered as a good practice to use event delegation.

[Event](https://github.com/bredele/event) uses query selection to delegate events:

{% highlight js %}
var list = document.querySelector('.list');

//execute fn only when a li element with the class item is clicked

event.attach(list, 'click li.item', fn);
{% endhighlight %}

The example above illustrate pretty well how useful event delegation is. Indeed I don't need to detach or reatach event handlers every time an element in the list is replaced or removed. I just have one event handler in the list element .

I'm kind of proud of how the component handle event delegation. I saw some libraries out there doing the same thing in hundreds of lines. Here's how I'm doing:

{% highlight js %}
//check if the target node answers the query selector
function matches(el, target, selector) {
  var nodes = el.querySelectorAll(selector);
  return [].slice.call(nodes).indexOf(target) > -1;
}
{% endhighlight %}

I didn't use [`matches`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element.matches) because it's not supported by IE8.

## <a class="post-section" href="#filtering">Event filtering</a>

I'm pretty sure you ended up doing something as following when you worked with forms input:

{% highlight js %}
input.addEventListener('keypress', function(ev) {
  //execute on enter
  if(ev.keyCode === 13) {
    //do something
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

Here's how you can do the same thing with [Event](https://github.com/bredele/event):

{% highlight js %}
//execute callback only on enter
event.attach(input, 'keypress > 13', fn);
{% endhighlight %}

Lovely right?

## <a class="post-section" href="#future">Future</a>

The next version of [Event](https://github.com/bredele/event) will support event keynames:

{% highlight js %}
//execute callback only on enter
event.attach(input, 'enter', fn);
{% endhighlight %}

touch events mapping:

{% highlight js %}
//listen touchend events if touch screen
event.attach(list, 'click', fn);
{% endhighlight %}

and also event aggregation:

{% highlight js %}
//execute callback on click or keypress enter
event.attach(list, 'click | enter', fn);
{% endhighlight %}
